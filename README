Overview
================================================================
This MBM HAL is based on the MBM HAL 4.0.0.0 BETA release for CyanogenMod 10 (Android JB): http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/mbm/index.php?title=MBM

It has been modified specifically for the HP TouchPad 4G which uses the Ericsson f5521gw Mobile Broadband Module (MBM).  The modifications may be applicable to other platforms using Ericsson MBMs and running Android JB.

Kernel Modifications
================================================================
Kernel modifications are available in the 'patches' directory that update acm, wdm, wdm, and usbnet.  

These are applicable for Linux kernels from 2.6.35 to 3.0.26 and are strongly recommended.  

Included is a correction to the ncm driver specifically related to a f5521gw firmware issue that otherwise caused gprs-data-stalls.

Android Modifications Are Required (not detailed, pending commit)
================================================================
Requires several corrections to Android ICS to properly recognize HSPA+ (HSPAP):
  telephony/java/android/telephony/NeighboringCellInfo.java
  telephony/java/com/android/internal/telephony/RIL.java
  etc...

Platform Implementation for HP TouchPad 4G
================================================================
The MBM HAL files in this repository should be added in vendor/mbm. 

Numerous changes are required in device/hp/tenderloin.  These are in a separate repos which can be added to you local_manifest.xml, as follows:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <manifest>
    <project name="CyanogenMod/hp-kernel-tenderloin" path="kernel/hp/tenderloin" remote="github" revision="ics" />
    <project name="CyanogenMod/android_hardware_atheros_wlan" path="hardware/atheros/wlan" remote="github" revision="jellybean" />
    <project name="NewbyJE/android_device_hp_tenderloin" path="device/hp/tenderloin" remote="github" revision="jellybean" />
    <project name="NewbyJE/android_vendor_mbm_beta" path="vendor/mbm" remote="github" revision="jellybean" />
  </manifest>
